# Unfold

A high-fidelity, personal daily timeline application optimized for the iPhone 12 Pro Max. This app features a premium dark aesthetic with a unique "Liquid Timeline" that prioritizes visual uniformity and clarity.

## What We've Built

- **Premium Dark UI**: A sleek, high-end interface with custom accent colors.
- **Liquid Timeline**: A non-linear mapping system that ensures even spacing between activity cards while maintaining mathematical time accuracy.
- **Smart Snapping**: A dynamic red indicator that automatically snaps to the start of your next pending activity.
- **Uniform Card Design**: Standardized card sizes (120px) for a consistent, rhythmic vertical flow.
- **Filtered Hour Markers**: Only displays hour labels for hours that contain scheduled events, keeping the interface clean and focused.
- **End-of-Day Countdown**: A live real-time countdown to the end of your day.

## Tech Stack

- **React**: Core UI framework.
- **TypeScript**: For robust, type-safe code.
- **Vite**: Ultra-fast development server and build tool.
- **Lucide React**: 🏷️ [lucide.dev](https://lucide.dev/) - Modern, professional icons used throughout the app.
- **Vanilla CSS**: Custom design system and layout logic.
